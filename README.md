## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. **Add the Resource**
- Place the entire script folder (e.g. `whereami`) in your server's `resources` directory.

### 2. **Configure Your Zones**
- Open `config.lua` and define your zones:
  - Set `name`, `description`, `coords`, `radius`, `type`, `color`, `icon`, `warning`, `sound`, and `soundType` as needed.
  - Example:
    ```lua
    {
      name = "Ballas Territory",
      description = "Ballas Gang Area - High Risk!",
      coords = vector3(110.0, -1960.0, 20.0),
      radius = 60.0,
      type = "gang",
      color = "#f43f5e",
      warning = "You are entering Ballas territory! Be careful.",
      sound = true,
      soundType = "gang",
      icon = "location_on"
    }
    ```

### 3. **Start the Resource**
- Add `ensure whereami` (or your folder name) to your `server.cfg`.

### 4. **Dependencies**
- Requires a working FiveM server (QBCore or standalone).
- No external dependencies‚ÄîReact NUI is bundled.

### 5. **Customization**
